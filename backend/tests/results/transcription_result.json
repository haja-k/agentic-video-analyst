They have the right to bear arms. Correct. But bears don't have arms. They do, actually. Oh, do they? I thought they were legs. Well, I'm not a biologist, but I suppose that when they stand up, they're probably arms. What was the Soviet onion? Well, I think you're leaving under a misapprehension and you probably mean the Soviet Union. No, it's onion. I saw it on a bit of paper earlier. Who is she? What's she smiling about? Is she holding a balloon between her knees? And if so, what colour is it? What's ironic about Jesus Christ becoming a carpenter was he was actually named after the two words you're most likely to shout after hitting your thumb with a hammer. Which is better, the Bible or the Quran? The Quran. So that one.",
